            <h2>Last Decade</br>
                of Earthquake</br>
                in Japan</h2>
            <p>When you first experiencing the earthquake for the first time you wonder how long and how strong it will be.
                You start searching and some time after you will probably stuck at earthquake. usgs.gov. It has every type
                of information about earthquake. Except one.It is really hard to tell how it fill So this study is trying
                to answer the question – how it feels to live with an earthquake in specific area during the year. We took
                data about earthquakes in Japan for lst 20 years and applied them on the map distruibuted by hexagons. Each
                hexagons recieved a set of multiplied values – summary for 20 years and 20 specific values per each year.</p>
